**This repository shows how to exeute the FP-growth associatice rule mining process using the Orange3 python package**


- The example file `data/test.relabund` is an example relative abundance file that would be output from the mothur software. This file is m x n where m are the samples and n are the various OTUs.


- Execution of `code/FP_growth_0.1.py` will output `results.txt` as well as `test.tab` which can be used to test the similarity of results obtained using the GUI version of Orange3

`results.txt` will contain the results of the mined rules.
