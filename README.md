**This repository shows how to apply the FP-growth associatice rule mining process to microbiome data using the Orange3 python package**


- The example file `data/test.relabund` is an example relative abundance file that would be output from the mothur software. This file is m x n where m are the samples and n are the various OTUs.

- Data input into the associative rule mining process must be discretized in some manner. The script `code/FP_growth_0.1.py` does this by indicating an OTU is present if it reaches the 0.1% relative abundance cutoff but the proper way to discretize microbiome data is still an open question.

- Execution of `code/FP_growth_0.1.py` will output `results.txt` as well as `test.tab` which can be used to test the similarity of results obtained using the GUI version of Orange3

- `results.txt` will contain the results of the mined rules.

- Results can be replicated using the Orange GUI version. The file fp_growth_relative_abundance.ows contains the same example analysis performed using the Orange3 GUI.
